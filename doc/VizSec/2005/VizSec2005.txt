abstract={ Anomalous communication patterns are one of the leading indicators of computer system intrusions according to the system administrators we have interviewed. But a major problem is being able to correlate across the host/network boundary to see how network connections are related to running processes on a host. This paper introduces Portall, a visualization tool that gives system administrators a view of the communicating processes on the monitored machine correlated with the network activity in which the processes participate. Portall is a prototype of part of the Network Eye framework we have introduced in an earlier paper (Ball, et al., 2004). We discuss the Portall visualization, the supporting infrastructure it requires, and a formative usability study we conducted to obtain administrators' reactions to the tool.},

abstract={ This paper presents the intrusion detection toolkit (IDtk), an information visualization tool for intrusion detection (ID). IDtk was developed through a user-centered design process, in which we identified design guidelines to support ID users. ID analysts protect their networks by searching for evidence of attacks in ID system output, firewall and system logs, and other complex, textual data sources. Monitoring and analyzing these sources incurs a heavy cognitive load for analysts. The use of information visualization techniques offers a valuable addition to the toolkit of the ID analyst. Several visualization techniques for ID have been developed, but few usability or field studies have been completed to assess the needs of ID analysts and the usability and usefulness of these tools. We intended to fill this gap by applying a user-centered design process in the development and evaluation of IDtk, a 3D, glyph-based visualization tool that gives the user maximum flexibility in setting up how the visualization display represents ID data. The user can also customize whether the display is a simple, high-level overview to support monitoring, or a more complex 3D view allowing for viewing the data from multiple angles and thus supporting analysis and diagnosis. This flexibility was found crucial in our usability evaluation. In addition to describing the tool, we report the findings of our user evaluation and propose new guidelines for the design of information visualization tools for ID.},

pages={ 29 - 38},
abstract={ Many methods have been developed for monitoring network traffic, both using visualization and statistics. Most of these methods focus on the detection of suspicious or malicious activities. But what they often fail to do refine and exercise measures that contribute to the characterization of such activities and their sources, once they are detected. In particular, many tools exist that detect network scans or visualize them at a high level, but not very many tools exist that are capable of categorizing and analyzing network scans. This paper presents a means of facilitating the process of characterization by using visualization and statistics techniques to analyze the patterns found in the timing of network scans through a method of continuous improvement in measures that serve to separate the components of interest in the characterization so the user can control separately for the effects of attack tool employed, performance characteristics of the attack platform, and the effects of network routing in the arrival patterns of hostile probes. The end result is a system that allows large numbers of network scans to be rapidly compared and subsequently identified.},

abstract={ Traffic anomalies and attacks are commonplace in today's networks and identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network operators. For a statistical intrusion detection system (IDS), it is crucial to detect at the flow-level for accurate detection and mitigation. However, existing IDS systems offer only limited support for: 1) interactively examining detected intrusions and anomalies; 2) analyzing worm propagation patterns; 3) and discovering correlated attacks. These problems are becoming even more acute as the traffic on today's high-speed routers continues to grow. IDGraphs is an interactive visualization system for intrusion detection that addresses these challenges. The central visualization in the system is a flow-level trace plotted with time on the horizontal axis and aggregated number of unsuccessful connections on the vertical axis. We then summarize a stack of tens or hundreds of thousands of these traces using the histographs (Pin Ren and Watson, 2005) technique, which maps data frequency at each pixel to brightness. Users may then interactively query the summary view, performing analysis by highlighting subsets of the traces. For example, brushing a linked correlation matrix view highlights traces with similar patterns, revealing distributed attacks that are difficult to detect using standard statistical analysis. We apply IDGraphs system to a real network router data-set with 179M flow-level records representing a total traffic of 1.16TB. The system successfully detects and analyzes a variety of attacks and anomalies, including port scanning, worm outbreaks, stealthy TCP SYN floodings, and some distributed attacks.},

pages={ 47 - 54},
abstract={ When performing packet-level analysis in intrusion detection, analysts often lose sight of the big picture while examining these low-level details. In order to prevent this loss of context and augment the available tools for intrusion detection analysis tasks, we developed an information visualization tool, the time-based network traffic visualizer (TNV). TNV is grounded in an understanding of the work practices of intrusion detection analysts, particularly foregrounding the overarching importance of context and time in the process of intrusion detection analysis. The main visual component of TNV is a matrix showing network activity of hosts over time, with connections between hosts superimposed on the matrix, complemented by multiple, linked views showing port activity and the details of the raw packets. Providing low-level textual data in the context of a high-level, aggregated graphical display enables analysts to examine packet-level details within the larger context of activity. This combination has the potential to facilitate the intrusion detection analysis tasks and help novice analysts learn what constitutes normal on a particular network.},

volume={},

pages={ 55 - 64},
abstract={ This paper introduces an adaptation of polar coordinates called root polar plotting that we have developed for our network pixel map, a computer security visualization capable of representing tens of thousands of hosts at a time. Root polar coordinates overcome two important problems of normal polar coordinates: plot density distortion and severe occlusion near the origin. We discuss several approaches we took while investigating this problem and provide empirical data from experiments we conducted comparing root polar coordinates against both normal polar and Cartesian coordinates. In any application where a polar plot would be useful but distortion of the data must be avoided, or where it is important to avoid some markers from being occluded by others, root polar coordinates may be useful. Our approach provides: (1) a novel adaptation of polar coordinates that overcomes plotting distortion; (2) a means of plotting network data in near real-time without complex layout optimization; (3) an algorithm that reduces occlusion of plotted points while maintaining consistent placement; and (4) an empirical comparison of Cartesian vs. polar plots.},

abstract={ We have designed an interactive visualization framework for the automated trust negotiation (ATN) protocol and we have implemented a prototype of the visualizer in Java. This framework provides capabilities to perform the interactive visualization of an ATN session, display credentials and policies, analyze the relations of negotiated components, and refine access control policies and negotiation strategies. We give examples of the visualization of ATN sessions and demonstrate the interactive features of the visualizer for the incremental construction of a trust target graph (TTG). Our prototype, which implements most components of the visualization framework, has played a key role in a research project that has developed working trust negotiation systems in an industrial environment.},

abstract={ The field of security visualization is in need of a paradigm shift in order to allow visualization tools to be practically used by security engineers. Security engineers must complete two different tasks, that of discovery of a pattern, and that of searching for a pattern in a data set. Current security visualizations do not aid the user in creating symbolic rules that represent visual patterns. Transforming visual patterns to symbolic rules requires effort by the security engineer and detracts from their main task of discovering interesting patterns. In this paper we describe the idea of closing-the-loop, a system where symbolic rules are created from visual patterns.},
